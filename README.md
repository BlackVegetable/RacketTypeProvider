# RacketTypeProvider
F#-style Type Providers in the Racket language

## Setup
The default Racket package management should be used to
install the info.rkt file.

After that, due to lame limitations that I totally should
fix, you will need to save any XML files you wish to use
to your /Racket folder OR use an absolute path name when
specifying the edit-time path within the macro call.

## Use
An example on how to use the Type Provider is available
in the xml-type-provider-use.rkt file. This will still
require you to copy the .txt file it references to /Racket
or modify it to use an absolute path.

## Contribution
Please feel free to contribute to this project via forking
this repo as with most Open Source Software. I will setup
better guidelines as this project continues to develop.
